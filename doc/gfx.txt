Graphics
========
The graphics module is currently written using the SDL_, OpenGL_, and
GLU_ interfaces. The interface (``gfx.h``) is currently simple, but
will have to be extended as features are added. In particular,
lighting has yet to be implemented (other than the single light
source originating from the camera - a temporary "solution").

Some implementation-independent graphics functions are also provided.
Currently these are just functions for loading geometry and texture
data into the graphics module in preparation for rendering, but more
functions will be added later for other things such as displaying
graphical effects and user interface components.
