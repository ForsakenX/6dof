Introduction
============
This project aims to produce a free (as in freedom) 6DoF first person
shooter game. 6DoF stands for "six degrees of freedom", meaning
players can move in any direction and rotate along any axis, without
being affected by gravity. Only a few games of this type have ever
been created, namely the Descent series and Forsaken. The newest one,
Descent 3, was released in 1999, making it over 9 years old as of this
writing.

This ``README`` file contains some project documentation describing
the various components and how they interact with each other. As the
project grows bigger and the amount of documentation increases, it
will eventually be split up into a set of multiple files describing
each component separately.

Since this project is still in its early development stages, you won't
find many things that will interest you unless you are a programmer
who wants to learn how it is organized, and perhaps help out. This
``README`` file should help you get started.

Overview
========
The game consists of a core written in C that is augmented by a Lua_
environment and controlled by Lua scripts. At its base lies a global
configuration system and a set of components that provide low-level
functionality used throughout the game (such as math functions), take
care of user interaction (audio, video, input), and perform
computations that take too much time to be done in Lua (like physics
and low-level artificial intelligence functions).

Layout
======
The core_ of the project consists of a set of macros and types, and
a `Lua environment`_ used to complement the C core.

Modules and components
======================
These modules implement specific functions and are mostly independent
from each other.

(One unfortunate exception to this is currently the input subsystem,
which uses SDL_ to access the various input devices. This requires
that SDL also be used for the graphics component. If a new graphics
subsystem is written that doesn't use SDL, a new input module will
need to be written as well.)

The interface (``*.h``) files contain specifications and descriptions
for the functions they define; they will not be repeated here.

Each of the modules are documented separately:

  * Audio_
  * `Controls and input devices`_
  * `Data I/O`_
  * Graphics_
  * Time_
