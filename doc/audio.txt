Audio
=====
A basic interface for audio modules has been designed and can be found
in the ``audio.h`` file. There is a "null" audio implementation that
provides the functions expected and used by the game's core, but does
not actually produce any sound.  It is the default audio module for
now, until the project has some sounds to use and an implementation
that produces sound, and may still remain useful in the future, e.g.
for dedicated servers.

A partial audio implementation based on SDL_mixer_ is also included,
but it may be a better idea to use OpenAL_ instead, since it provides a
3D sound interface.
