Physics
=======
This component has yet to be written. It will likely use ODE_. Some
temporary "physics" code is in place to provide 6DoF-style camera
movement and rotation. This code is currently in ``game.c`` (which
implements the main game loop), and will be taken out (or at least
moved elsewhere) later on when a game world and object model have been
added.
