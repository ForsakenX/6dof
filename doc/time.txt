Time
====
Provides game time and FPS (frames per second) information. The time
module is currently trivial, with just a few globally accessible
variables and a function to update them. This is enough for now. Later
on, functions may be added to speed up, slow down, and pause/resume
the game time, and provide functions to fire off time-based events.
