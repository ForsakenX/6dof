File system
===========
This module will take care of accessing game files and scripts.
Basically it is an abstraction layer that takes care of finding files
in their appropriate places and/or in archives as well as providing
I/O functions.

Currently, only a preliminary file interface and module have been
written and they aren't actually used yet. This should change soon...

PhysFS_ may be a useful library to use for this component.
