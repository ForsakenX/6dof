Math
====
Some basic functions have been provided to work with vectors, which
are used to denote 3D coordinates, and quaternions to denote 3D object
orientations. Matrix functions may also be added at some point.

All of these functions use the ``scalar`` type for floating-point
numbers. The precision of this type can be set at compile-time and
defaults to the C ``float`` data type.

C math functions that write their result to a specified memory address
first compute their result locally. This is a little less efficient in
most cases, but it has the benefit of allowing their destination
parameter to equal one or both of their source parameters::

    vector v1 = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f};
    vector v2 = {3.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f};
    vec_crossprod(&v1, &v1, &v2);
    /* v1 now contains {-4.0f, 8.0f, -4.0f}. */

`The Lua environment`_ is also enhanced with some vector functions.
See below for some examples. Quaternion and matrix functionality may
follow later on.
