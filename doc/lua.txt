The Lua environment
===================
The game uses Lua_ to provide a flexible scripting environment. It
will be used for most high-level stuff and to control what the game
does, such as displaying menus, starting levels, setting options, and
manipulating the game world.

Currently, the Lua environment is just used for configuration, input
binding, and generating level geometry data.

Configuration
-------------
The ``config`` table stores the configuration values. See the `Global
configuration system`_ section above for a more detailed description
of the configuration system.

Controls
--------
Input binding is done exclusively via the Lua environment. The
``input`` table holds all input-related tables and functions.
``input.id`` is a table that maps input names to input IDs.
``input.bindings`` holds the actual bindings - what inputs are mapped
to which functions. Neither of these two tables is meant to be
accessed directly; two functions ``input.bind`` and ``input.unbind``
are provided to add and remove bindings. An example of how to use
``input.bind`` has already been given in the Input_ section above.
Additional examples can be found in the ``bindings.lua`` file, which
is read and executed at the end of the initialization process.

Levels
------
Levels are loaded by executing a Lua script that will return the
vertex/face data to be put in the corresponding low-level structures
for processing by the game components that use it, notably graphics
and physics.

This provides some interesting opportunities for level designers,
since such scripts can produce this data in various ways. Anything
from providing static geometry data, to reading such data from various
file types, or even automatically generating it, or any combination of
these, is possible. Examples of the first two are already included.

A similar means of providing sound and texture data may be added later
on.

Models
------
Level / polymodel data table passed from Lua to C::

    {
        ['vertices'] = vertices;
        ['faces'] = faces;
    }

where

::

    vertices = { {x1,y1,z1}, {x2,y2,z2}, ... }
    faces = { v1, v2, ..., key = value, ... }

``key`` and ``value`` can be:

* ``['normal'] = {x,y,z}``: face normal.
* ``['texture'] = handle``: texture handle as provided by the graphics
  subsystem.

``v1``, ``v2``, ... are tables containing per-vertex data:

* ``['index'] = i``: vertex index.
* ``['normal'] = {x,y,z}``: per-vertex face normal.
* ``['texcoords'] = {s, t}``: texture coordinates.
* ``['material'] = handle``: material handle as provided by the
  graphics subsystem.

Lua functions to load levels and models will be provided later
(or sooner), in a way similar to the texture functions (see below).

Vectors
-------
Vectors can be created and used like this::

    v = vec(1,2,3)
    w = vec({3,2,1})
    print(('%d,%d,%d'):format(v.x, v.y, v.z)) -- '1,2,3' (coordinates)
    print(v+w) -- '(4, 4, 4)'
    print(v-w) -- '(-2, 0, 2)'
    print(v*2) -- '(2, 4, 6)'
    print(v*w) -- '10' (dot product)
    print(-v) -- '(-1, -2, -3)' (reverse)
    print(v:len()) -- '3.7416573867739' (magnitude)
    print(v:norm()) -- '(0.267261, 0.534522, 0.801784)' (normalized)
    print(v:cross(w)) -- '(-4, 8, -4)' (cross product)

Sounds
------
::

    -- load a sound sample
    audio.load('mysoundhandlename', 'filename.wav')
    -- play it
    handle = audio.play('mysoundhandlename', 65535, 0, 0)
    -- or positional --
    handle = audio.play3d('mysoundhandlename', vec(1, 2, 3), 65535, 0)
    -- stop the sound
    audio.stop(handle)
    -- unload it
    audio.free('mysoundhandlename')

Textures
--------
To load a texture into the graphics module and prepare it for
rendering::

    handle = gfx.texture({
        width = w;
        height = h;
        flags = 0; -- to be defined
        data = d;
    })

where ``w`` and ``h`` are integers and ``d`` is a Lua string
containing the pixel data in RGB format, one byte per color component.

The handle should be kept in the Lua environment somewhere until it's
no longer needed - when the handle gets garbage-collected, the
corresponding texture goes with it. The game keeps the level data
structure (which contains references to these handles) around and so
this need not be done explicitly.

Lua texture loaders can already be created and used this way; for
example::

    handle = gfx.texture(loadfile('mytexloader.lua')(args))

Materials
---------
Materials can be created and used in a way similar to textures::

    handle = gfx.material({
        flags = 0;
        color = {r,g,b};
        specular = {sr,sg,sb};
        alpha = 1;
    })
    handle2 = gfx.material({
        flags = gfx.MATERIAL_FULL;
        ambient = {ar,ag,ab};
        diffuse = {dr,dg,db};
        specular = {sr,sg,sb};
        emission = {er,eg,eb};
        shininess = 1;
        alpha = 1;
    })

**NOTE**: The material system is likely to change later, more so than
the rest of the graphics subsystem.

Miscellaneous Lua functions
---------------------------
These are some additional functions that don't fall into any other
category:

* a ``DEBUG`` function that acts similar to the C macro defined in
  ``common.h``. See the `Debug information`_ section for some
  examples;
* a ``warn`` function to issue warnings; currently equivalent to
  Lua's ``print`` function;
* ``unpack`` is similar to Perl's ``unpack`` and Python's
  ``struct.unpack``; it extracts binary data from a string::

    -- Reads a 32-bit signed integer and a float from str
    local i, f = unpack('if', str)

* ``binread`` works like ``unpack`` but reads its data from a file
  handle, automatically reading the correct amount of bytes from the
  stream::

    -- Reads a 16-bit signed integer followed by a vector (3 floats)
    -- (14 bytes total) from the filehandle f, storing the integer in
    -- n and the vector in v.
    local n, v = f:binread('hv')

* a ``binfile`` function to add the ``binread`` method to Lua file
  handles, for example::

    local f = binfile(io.open(config.lvlfile, 'rb'))
