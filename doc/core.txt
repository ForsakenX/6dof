Core
====
This section describes the "glue" that ties the various components
together. `The Lua environment`_ has its own section further below.

Core project files
------------------
* ``common.h`` includes all header files used and defines a couple of
  macros used throughout the project.

* ``config.c`` and ``config.h`` define the functions for retrieving
  configuration values in C code.

* ``config.lua`` sets up the configuration table and loads it with
  values from ``defaults.lua``.

* ``debug.h`` defines the debug macros.

* ``defaults.lua`` defines options and their initial default values.

* ``game.c`` and ``game.h`` define the core of the game world model
  and contain the main loop. (Currently the "model" is just the level
  with a camera flying through it - basic physics for the camera are
  also implemented here for now).

* ``global.c`` and ``global.h`` define global variables and
  miscellaneous functions that are used throughout the code.

* ``init.lua`` sets up the Lua environment and processes the
  commandline.

* ``lua_funcs.c`` and ``lua_funcs.h`` define miscellaneous Lua
  functions written in C. Currently these are just the ``unpack``
  function which acts in a way similar to Perl's function of the same
  name, and the ``binread`` function which combines this functionality
  with reading from a file handle. The latter is used extensively by
  the Descent and Forsaken level/model reader scripts.

* ``main.c`` contains the game's entry point. See below.

* ``scalar.h`` contains some macros for working with the ``scalar``
  type. It provides ``scalar`` equivalents for math library functions
  such as ``sin``, ``cos``, and ``sqrt``. These ``scalar`` versions
  use the ``s`` suffix, yielding function names like ``sins``,
  ``coss``, and ``sqrts``.

* ``types.h``: declares commonly used types. These include the
  ``vector`` and ``quat`` (quaternion) types. They are defined here
  instead of in ``vector.h`` and ``quaternion.h`` since some
  operations may involve both of these types, so they have to be
  declared before any functions that involve both types.

* ``util.lua`` contains miscellaneous functions written in Lua.

``main`` and the initialization process
---------------------------------------
When ``main()`` is called, the first thing the game does is create the
Lua environment and initialize it, then execute the ``init.lua``
script, which in turn runs ``config.lua`` to set up the configuration
table, then loads the Lua utility functions in ``util.lua`` and
``vector.lua``, and finally processes the commandline.

Controls goes back to C at which point the ``lua_funcs`` will be
registered (this step *may* later be performed before running
``init.lua``). The game then proceeds by initializing each subsystem
(audio_, graphics_, input_) and the game world code, and finally
running ``bindings.lua`` to load the user's input configuration.

What happens at this point is subject to some major change as the game
develops. Currently, a level is loaded as indicated by some
configuration values and the main game loop is entered immediately.

Debug information
-----------------
The game has two debugging parameters: channel mask and level.
Channels separate different types of debug info and can be enabled or
disabled in debugging output. The debug level specifies the detail of
information that is printed.

``debug.h`` defines a ``DEBUGX`` macro that the rest of the code can
use to print debugging messages::

    DEBUGX(type, level, format, ...)

where ``format`` and any remaining arguments are the same as for
``printf``. Typically, a module will define a ``DEBUG`` macro for
itself that calls ``DEBUGX`` with a default debug channel. For
example::

    #define DEBUG(level, x...) DEBUGX(DBG_AUDIO, level, x)
    /* ... */
    DEBUG(1, "Initializing audio subsystem\n");

There are 3 debug levels:

* 1 - initialization and shutdown information; major changes in state
  such as starting a new game::

    DEBUG(1, "Initializing graphics subsystem\n");
    DEBUG(1, "Using SDL for graphics\n");
    DEBUG(1, "gfx_sdl: using video driver \"%s\"\n",
      SDL_VideoDriverName(drv_name, 64));
    DEBUG(1, "Found joystick %d: \"%s\"\n", i+1, SDL_JoystickName(i));

* 2 - information about uncommon events and the actions triggered by
  them. As a guideline, take 'uncommon' here to mean 'not at least
  once every frame'::

    DEBUG(2, "audio_null: load_sound(%s)\n", filename);
    (in Lua)  DEBUG(2, ('Header says %d verts, %d cubes'):
                format(nverts, ncubes))
    DEBUG(2, "audio_null: play_sound(%d, %d, %.3f, %#x)\n",
      soundno, volume, panning, flags);
    DEBUG(2, "Calling C function for input event %d\n", event.id);
    DEBUG(2, "Key press event, id == %d\n", event->id);

* 3 - information about common events (triggered at least once every
  frame) and functions typically invoked in a loop::

    DEBUG(3, "%s:%d: reading %d bytes\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, n);
    DEBUG(3, "Processing input events\n");
    DEBUG(3, "gfx_sdl: render()\n");

Global configuration system
---------------------------
The game has a global table to store configuration values. Its purpose
is to make certain parameters easily adjustable by the user, and
easily accessible by the game's code (even its C code). Here's how it
works and how to use it:

* In the early stage of game initialization, a special Lua table
  called ``config`` is created and loaded with values from
  ``defaults.lua``. This file contains initial (default) values for
  the options. At the same time, it determines what options exist; it
  is not possible to add new options after initialization.

* Immediately after this, the game parses the commandline used to run
  it. Commandline options can be used to override the default values
  specified in ``defaults.lua``. The game looks for arguments of the
  form ``--option=value``, ``--no-option``, and ``--option``. The
  first form assigns a string or number value to an option. The second
  and third forms disable and enable a boolean (on/off) option,
  respectively.

* From within the Lua environment, options can be accessed as
  ``config.optionname``. For example::

    print(('The current screen mode is %dx%dx%d'):format(
      config.width, config.height, config.bpp
    ))

* In C code, use the ``config_get_int``, ``config_get_float``, and ``config_get_str`` functions. ``config_get_int`` is also used for booleans. Example::

    printf("Current mouse sensitivity: x=%f, y=%f\n",
      config_get_float("mousesensx"), config_get_float("mousesensy")
    );
    printf("Joystick is %s\n",
      config_get_int("joystick") ? "enabled" : "disabled"
    );

* Options can be changed from within the Lua environment, but there
  are no equivalent ``config_set_*`` functions in C. Currently, most
  (if not all) options are used only during initialization, so
  changing them afterwards has no effect. This *may* change if/when
  configuration events are introduced (see below).

That's pretty much all there is to it. To introduce a new option all
you have to do is add it to ``defaults.lua``, and you can start using
it.

Later on, an event system may be introduced that can notify modules of
changes in the configuration, so they can use local variables to hold
parameters and don't have to repeatedly poll the config table.
